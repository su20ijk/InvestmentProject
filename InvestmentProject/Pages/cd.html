CDs are generally issued by banks. CDs can be issued in any denomination above the minimum requirement, which usually is $500 to $1,000. The money needs to remain until the term ends, with penalties for early withdrawals.</div>

                <p>Certificates of Deposit are not liquid. The money put into it must be left in it until maturity. You should have access to other money while waiting for the term to end. On top of that is compound interest, which only gets better by time. Younger people should have the time to wait and maximize their return.</p>

                <h6>Mid to high income</h6>
                <p>
                    Certificates of Deposit have low interest rates that do not keep up with the inflation rate. Investors should have another source of income as CDs only really supplement someone's earnings. And since the money is inaccessible, investors need to have other sources of income.

                <p>
                    Certificates of Deposit are very appealing to the investors looking for safe investments. CDs have low volatility and are insured by the FDIC. These investments are basically guaranteed to pay off, as long as you're willing ot wait for it.
