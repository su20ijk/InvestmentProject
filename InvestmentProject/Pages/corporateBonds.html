                <p>Like most investments, Corporate bonds have maturities, which means the principle will not be paid until the end of the term. Younger investors have time on their side, and thus it is keen of them to invest in bonds.</p>

                    Corporate bonds are a tad expensive, with the cheapest ones being around $5000 and $10000. Investors should be able to afford such an investment.

                <h6 style="text-align: center">Investors interested in fixed rate of return and safety</h6>
                <p>For the most part, corporate bonds provide a safe and steady return higher than other bonds. Their APY is dependent on the issuers and agreements, but as long as the comany has a good rating, the investment is relatively safe.</p>
