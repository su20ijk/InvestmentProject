Typical municpal bonds have a minimum denomination of $5,000, but there are some issues with a minimum denomination of $100,000. Municipal bonds are tax-exempt from federal income tax.</div>

                <p>Municipal Bonds like any bond are suited for all ages. Time of course is a huge factor, so younger investors tend to benefit. However, municipal bonds also provide steady income for retirees.</p>

                <p>Municipal Bonds sell with the lowest being around $5000. Therefore, investors should have the resources to expend on this investment, as the investment itself cannot compete against inflation rates</p>

                <p>The most notable feature of Muncipal Bonds is that they are tax-free on the federal, and sometimes state and local levels. If an investor wants to lower their taxes and have low-risk investments, Municipal Bonds are a good option</p>
