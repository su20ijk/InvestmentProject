                <p>Like all bonds, Federal Government Bonds have maturities. The principle will not be paid until the end of the term. Most of these bonds can have maturities from 10 to 30 years, so the investor better have time on his side. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, these bonds can be a steady source of income for those in or nearing retirement, making them benifical to older folks.</p>

                <p>Federal Government Bonds are relatively affordable, with the minimum denomination being $1000. However, these interest rates do not keep up with inflation, so investors should have other sources of income. </p>

                <h6 style="text-align: center">Investors looking for steady returns</h6>
                <p>Federal Government Bonds are backed by the US government. The government has never made a late payment, nor has it ever defaulted on a loan. If safety is important to the investor, than this is the investment they want</p>
